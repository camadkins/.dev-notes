## Why
History explains *why* designs look the way they do: domain needs, hardware, and paradigm shifts.

## Core landmarks
- **1950s–60s**: Fortran (scientific), LISP (AI), ALGOL (structure), COBOL (business).
- **1970s**: Pascal (teaching), C (systems), structured programming.
- **1980s–90s**: OO (Smalltalk, C++), Java (VM portability).
- **1990s+**: scripting/rapid prototyping (Perl, Python, JS); later multiparadigm.

## Idea
Genealogy shows **influence lines**, not rankings; many modern languages are multiparadigm.

> [!warning] Pitfall
> Reading genealogy as “better vs worse” instead of “inspired by”.
