## Why
Different abstraction levels trade **fine-grained control** for **portability and productivity**.

## Core definitions
- **Machine language**: raw opcodes; architecture-specific.
- **Assembly**: mnemonic, ~1:1 with machine ops.
- **High-level**: abstracts machine details; compiled and/or interpreted.

## Idea
Higher levels → faster development & portability; lower levels → maximal control & predictability.

> [!warning] Common trap
> “High-level is always slow.” Modern JITs and optimizers blur that assumption.

## Mini-example
Loop in assembly (explicit jumps/registers) vs high-level `for` (intent clear, compiler handles details).
